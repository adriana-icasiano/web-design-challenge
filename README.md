# Web Design Homework - Web Visualization Dashboard (Latitude)

## Background

Data is more powerful when we share it with others! Let's take what we've learned about HTML and CSS to create a dashboard showing off the analysis we've done.

## Latitude - Latitude Analysis Dashboard with Attitude

For this homework we'll be creating a visualization dashboard website using visualizations we've created in a past assignment. Specifically, we'll be plotting [weather data](Resources/cities.csv).

In building this dashboard, we'll create individual pages for each plot and a means by which we can navigate between them. These pages will contain the visualizations and their corresponding explanations. We'll also have a landing page, a page where we can see a comparison of all of the plots, and another page where we can view the data used to build them.

### Website Requirements

The website must consist of 7 pages total, including:

## A landing page containing
  * An explanation of the project.
  * Links to each visualizations page. There should be a sidebar containing preview images of each plot, and clicking an image should take the user to that visualization.

## Landing page - large screen

## Landing page - small screen

## Four visualization pages, each with:
  * A descriptive title and heading tag.
  * The plot/visualization itself for the selected comparison.
  * A paragraph describing the plot and its significance.

## Temperature visualization page - large screen:

## A Comparison page that:
  * Contains all of the visualizations on the same page so we can easily visually compare them.
  * Uses a Bootstrap grid for the visualizations.

## A Data page that:
  * Displays a responsive table containing the data used in the visualizations.

## A navigation menu that is responsive. See screenshots above.


Finally, the website must be deployed to GitHub pages.

When finished, submit to BootcampSpot the links to 1) the deployed app and 2) the GitHub repository.

Ensure your repository has regular commits (i.e. 20+ commits) and a thorough README.md file
